                            Local Storage
                            <hr>
                            (i) while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in
                            sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. <br>

                            (ii)A Storage object which can be used to access the current origin's local storage space.
                            <br>
                            (iii) localStorage returns a different object than localStorage for the corresponding site
                            loaded over HTTPS <br>
                            (iv) For documents loaded from file: URLs the requirements for localStorage behavior are
                            undefined and may vary among different browsers. <br>
                            (v)The syntax for reading the localStorage:
                            localStorage.setItem(); //
                            localStorage.getItem(); //

                            Session Storage
                            <hr>
                            (i)Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the
                            browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab. <br>

                            (ii)A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open, and survives over page
                            reloads and restores. <br>

                            (iii)Opening multiple tabs/windows with the same URL creates sessionStorage for each
                            tab/window.
                            <br>

                            (iv)Duplicating a tab copies the tab's sessionStorage into the new tab.

                            (v)Closing a tab/window ends the session and clears objects in sessionStorage.

                                Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. <br>
                                Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a

                                All scripts and functions on a web page can access it.

                                    Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. <br>
                                    ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. <br>
                                    These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. <br>
                                    Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block .
                                    {
                                    let x = 2;
                                    }
                                    // x can NOT be used here
                                    Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope. <br>
                                    Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.

                            JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing
                            <br>
                            the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is
                            <br>
                            quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.
                            The event loop is the secret behind
                            <br>
                            JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all

                            operations on a single thread,
                            <br> but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the
                            illusion of multi-threading
